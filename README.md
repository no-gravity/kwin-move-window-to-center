# Move Window to Center
A simple KWin script that introduces a KDE Global Shortcut for centering the active window in the current screen.

This fork kinda works in Plasma 5.20.5

## Usage
cd into the repo and execute this command:
```console
kpackagetool5 --type=KWin/Script -i .
```

I then started the "Shortcuts" editor in KDE, searched for "center" and
added a shortcut. Then it worked.

I did a bit of experimentation with the code, and now I don't
know how to deinstall the plugin anymore. So I'm not sure
it will really work with the two-step processs described
above.
